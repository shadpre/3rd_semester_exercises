### Level 0: Getting started

Start out by installing the .NET 8.0 runtime and SDK here: 
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0



**Task:**

Before you start the unit test exercises at level 1,
I recommend taking some time getting familiar with the .NET command line interface (CLI).




You can always write --help after a command to get help (like valid arguments / options, what the command does, etc)

Try exploring and using the following commands:

- dotnet new [application type here]
- dotnet build
- dotnet run
- dotnet test

**Success Criteria:** Getting the expected outcome of the commands without too many surprises.

**Learning Objective:** Being able to use the .NET CLI independent of IDE / Text editor
